"# Classynotnasty" 
This project has been more work than I had initially thought. The project came from an Idea I had 4 years ago
The idea was to find an easy way to find if a song is clean or dirty lyricwise
I was sucessful in this!!!! Only the 7 dirty words but I was still able to accomplish this
The most difficult part of this project was learning the sorting of lists and strings. 
I feel like I know the string functions and the list functions like the back of my hand and I think I will easily be able to use these functions in the future.
